# Q: Please write a step-by-step actions what to do, what to write if I want to move my calculations to workers which would be later deployed in Kubernetes cluster and connect to the main node. Focus only on using Autogen features and Python code related - GrpcWorkerAgentRuntimeHost, etc. Please write what to do to calculate analyze_full_data from data_utils.py logically in a Grpc Worker and return the result back to the main flow 
# A:

# Offloading `analyze_full_data` to a gRPC Worker Agent in Autogen

To move your `analyze_full_data` function to worker agents that will be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster and connect to your main node, you can use Autogen's features for distributed agent communication over gRPC. Specifically, you can use `GrpcWorkerAgentRuntimeHost` on the worker side and `GrpcAgentRuntimeClient` on the main node to communicate.

Below are step-by-step instructions, focusing on using Autogen features and the necessary Python code to achieve this.

---

## Step 1: Understand the Architecture

- **Main Node**: Runs your primary application, including agents like `CoordinatorAgent`, `FinalPipelineAgent`, etc.
- **Worker Node**: Runs the worker runtime (`GrpcWorkerAgentRuntimeHost`) and hosts the worker agent that can execute `analyze_full_data`.
- **Communication**: The main node communicates with worker agents over gRPC, which is abstracted by Autogen's runtime classes.

---

## Step 2: Prepare the Worker Agent

Create a worker agent that can handle the execution of `analyze_full_data`.

### 2.1 Create `WorkerAgent`

**File**: `agents/worker_agent.py`

```python
from autogen_core import RoutedAgent, rpc, MessageContext
from agents.common import OverviewInfo
from utils.data_utils import analyze_full_data
import pandas as pd

class WorkerAgent(RoutedAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(description="Worker Agent")

    @rpc
    async def perform_analysis(self, message: dict, ctx: MessageContext) -> OverviewInfo:
        dataframe_dict = message['dataframe']
        dataframe = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(dataframe_dict)
        # Perform the analysis
        overview_info = analyze_full_data(dataframe)
        return overview_info
```

**Notes**:

- `analyze_full_data` must be available on the worker node. Ensure `data_utils.py` is accessible in the worker's codebase.
- We're using `OverviewInfo` as the return type, which should be defined in `agents/common.py`.

---

## Step 3: Set Up `GrpcWorkerAgentRuntimeHost` on the Worker Node

Create a script to run the worker agent.

### 3.1 Create `worker_main.py`

**File**: `worker_main.py`

```python
import asyncio
from autogen_core.application import GrpcWorkerAgentRuntimeHost
from agents.worker_agent import WorkerAgent

async def main():
    host = '0.0.0.0'  # Bind to all interfaces
    port = 50051      # Port to listen on

    # Initialize the worker runtime host
    worker_runtime = GrpcWorkerAgentRuntimeHost(bind_address=host, bind_port=port)

    # Register the WorkerAgent
    await WorkerAgent.register(runtime=worker_runtime, type="worker_agent_type", factory=WorkerAgent)

    # Start the worker runtime
    worker_runtime.start()
    print(f"Worker runtime started at {host}:{port}")

    # Keep the server running indefinitely
    await asyncio.Event().wait()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**Notes**:

- The worker runtime listens on `0.0.0.0:50051` for incoming gRPC requests.
- Ensure that `autogen_core.application` has `GrpcWorkerAgentRuntimeHost`.

---

## Step 4: Modify the Main Node to Connect to the Worker Runtime via gRPC

On the main node, you'll use `GrpcAgentRuntimeClient` to connect to the worker runtime.

### 4.1 Update `main.py`

**Update imports**:

```python
from autogen_core.application import GrpcAgentRuntimeClient
# Other existing imports...
```

**Add gRPC connection to the worker runtime**:

```python
async def main():
    runtime = SingleThreadedAgentRuntime()
    model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model_name=MODEL_NAME, api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)

    # Connect to the worker runtime via gRPC
    worker_host = 'worker-service'  # Replace with the actual hostname or IP
    worker_port = 50051             # Port on which the worker runtime is listening

    # Initialize the gRPC client
    worker_runtime_client = GrpcAgentRuntimeClient(worker_host, worker_port)

    # Register the worker runtime with the main runtime
    await runtime.add_runtime_connection(worker_runtime_client)

    # existing agent registrations
    await CoordinatorAgent.register(...)
    # ... other registrations ...

    runtime.start()

    # Rest of your main function...

    # Shutdown runtimes when done
    await runtime.stop()
    await worker_runtime_client.close()
```

**Notes**:

- Replace `'worker-service'` with the actual DNS name or IP address of your worker node. In Kubernetes, this could be the service name exposing your worker pod.
- By adding the worker runtime connection to your main runtime, messages can be routed to agents on the worker runtime seamlessly.

---

## Step 5: Modify `FinalPipelineAgent` to Use the Worker Agent

Update the `FinalPipelineAgent` to send the `analyze_full_data` task to the `WorkerAgent`.

### 5.1 Update `agents/final_pipeline_agent.py`

```python
from autogen_core import RoutedAgent, rpc, MessageContext, AgentId
from agents.common import FinalResult, OverviewInfo
from typing import Dict

class FinalPipelineAgent(RoutedAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(description="Final Pipeline Agent")

    @rpc
    async def run_final_pipeline(self, message: Dict, ctx: MessageContext) -> FinalResult:
        dataframe_dict = message['dataframe']
        info = message.get('info', {})

        # Create the AgentId for the WorkerAgent
        worker_agent_id = AgentId(type="worker_agent_type", key="default")  # Assuming key is 'default'

        # Send the analysis request to the WorkerAgent
        overview_info: OverviewInfo = await self.send_message(
            message={'dataframe': dataframe_dict},
            recipient=worker_agent_id,
            cancellation_token=ctx.cancellation_token
        )

        # Proceed to the analysis agent
        analysis_agent_id = await self.runtime.get('analysis_agent_type', key='analysis_agent')
        analysis_result = await self.send_message(
            message=overview_info,
            recipient=analysis_agent_id,
            cancellation_token=ctx.cancellation_token
        )

        return FinalResult(result=analysis_result)
```

**Notes**:

- The `AgentId` for the worker agent must match the type and key used when registering the `WorkerAgent` on the worker runtime.
- The `send_message` call will automatically route the message to the worker runtime because of the connected `GrpcAgentRuntimeClient`.
- Ensure that `OverviewInfo` is properly defined and serializable.

---

## Step 6: Ensure Consistent Agent IDs and Types

- **Agent Types and Keys**: Make sure that the agent types and keys are consistent between the main node and worker node.

- **WorkerAgent Registration on Worker Runtime**:

  ```python
  await WorkerAgent.register(runtime=worker_runtime, type="worker_agent_type", factory=WorkerAgent)
  ```

- **WorkerAgent Invocation in `FinalPipelineAgent`**:

  ```python
  worker_agent_id = AgentId(type="worker_agent_type", key="default")
  ```

---

## Step 7: Deploy the Worker and Main Nodes

### 7.1 Worker Node Deployment

- **Dockerize the Worker**: Create a Docker image containing `worker_main.py`, all necessary dependencies, and your codebase.

- **Kubernetes Deployment**:

  - Create a `Deployment` and `Service` for the worker.
  - Expose the worker via a ClusterIP or Headless service, making sure it's accessible from the main node.

### 7.2 Main Node Deployment

- **Dockerize the Main Application**: Include `main.py` and required dependencies.

- **Configure Environment**:

  - Set environment variables or configuration files to specify the `worker_host` and `worker_port`.

- **Deployment**:

  - Create a `Deployment` for the main application.

**Notes**:

- Ensure that network policies allow communication between the main and worker pods over the gRPC port (e.g., 50051).
- In Kubernetes, you can use service discovery (e.g., DNS) to allow the main node to resolve the worker node's address.

---

## Step 8: Test the End-to-End Flow

- **Start the Worker Runtime**: Ensure the worker runtime is up and running and accessible.

- **Run the Main Application**: Start your main application and provide user input.

- **Verify**:

  - The `FinalPipelineAgent` should send the analysis request to the `WorkerAgent` via gRPC.
  - The `WorkerAgent` performs the `analyze_full_data` function and returns the `OverviewInfo`.
  - The main application proceeds with the `AnalysisAgent` to generate the final report.

---

## Additional Considerations

### Error Handling

- Implement try-except blocks to handle network errors, timeouts, or agent not found errors when communicating with the worker runtime.

### Serialization

- Ensure that the data being sent between agents is serializable (e.g., DataFrames converted to dictionaries or JSON).

### Security

- If necessary, secure your gRPC connections using TLS.

### Scaling

- You can add more worker nodes by deploying additional instances of the worker runtime and connecting them to your main runtime.

### Monitoring

- Implement logging and monitoring to trace messages and agent interactions across the distributed system.

---

## Summary

By following these steps:

- **Worker Agent**: You've created a `WorkerAgent` that can execute `analyze_full_data` on the worker node.

- **Worker Runtime**: You've set up a `GrpcWorkerAgentRuntimeHost` to host the `WorkerAgent`.

- **gRPC Communication**: You've connected your main runtime to the worker runtime via `GrpcAgentRuntimeClient`.

- **Agent Communication**: You've modified `FinalPipelineAgent` to send the analysis task to the `WorkerAgent` and await the result.

- **Kubernetes Deployment**: You're prepared to deploy both main and worker nodes in a Kubernetes cluster with proper networking.

---

## Example Workflow

1. **User Input**: The user provides input that initiates the processing pipeline.

2. **CoordinatorAgent**: Determines initial pipeline and starts the process.

3. **FinalPipelineAgent**: Upon reaching the final stage, sends a message to `WorkerAgent`.

4. **WorkerAgent**:

   - Receives the message via gRPC.
   - Executes `analyze_full_data`.
   - Returns `OverviewInfo` back to `FinalPipelineAgent`.

5. **FinalPipelineAgent**:

   - Receives the `OverviewInfo`.
   - Proceeds to `AnalysisAgent`.

6. **AnalysisAgent**: Generates the final report using LLM.

---

By offloading compute-intensive tasks to worker nodes, you can improve the scalability and performance of your application, leveraging Kubernetes for orchestration and Autogen for seamless agent communication.
