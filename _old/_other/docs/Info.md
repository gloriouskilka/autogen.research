AutoGen 0.4 - new event-driven actor model architecture, designed for scale, resilience, flexibility, forward looking feature development, driven by customer and community feedback, support x-lang agent communication, will be supported in Semantic Kernel as well. Built by dedicated teams at MSFT, continuing and growing investment, used in multiple MSFT products and services (not moving to maintained by community - not sure where that's coming from)
Semantic Kernel - a general purpose AI application SDK that will take a dependency on the Autogen runtime for multi agent. You can seek enterprise support for SK.

I am using AutoGen, what’s my path for product support?
If you’re using the multi-agent runtime from AutoGen, in early 2025 there will be an option to seamlessly transition into Semantic Kernel; this would alleviate the burden of having to productize it on your own and you can rely on an enterprise-ready runtime for your multi-agent solution.

If you’re willing to harden and make AutoGen enterprise ready with your overall solution, then you can continue using it with community support only. Customers might choose this path if they have a need for complex agentic patterns that are not yet available in Semantic Kernel or any other product.

Are there any resources to help me get started with these frameworks?
Yes, Microsoft provides resources for both frameworks:
