# # testing_framework_example.py: Testing Agents and Tools in Autogen Framework
#
# # This example demonstrates how to create a testing system for verifying the stability
# # and correctness of agent interactions with LLMs, specifically focusing on function
# # calls and parameter passing. It includes a custom test client that simulates the
# # OpenAI API, intercepts function tool calls, and verifies the function names and parameters.
#
# # =============================================================================
# # Overview
# # =============================================================================
#
# # The testing framework consists of:
# # - A mock ChatCompletionClient that simulates the behavior of the OpenAI LLM.
# # - Interceptors that capture and validate function calls and arguments.
# # - Utilities for asserting expected behaviors.
# # - Example agents and tools to demonstrate testing usage.
#
#     # =============================================================================
#     # Implementation Details and Recommendations
#     # =============================================================================
#
#     # 1. **Mocking the ChatCompletionClient**
#
#     #    - The `MockChatCompletionClient` simulates the behavior of the OpenAI LLM.
#     #    - It allows you to predefine expected function calls and capture the function calls made by the agent.
#     #    - This enables you to test whether the agent correctly interprets and generates function calls based on messages.
#
#     # 2. **Intercepting and Verifying Function Calls**
#
#     #    - The `get_function_calls()` method provides access to the list of function calls made during the test.
#     #    - `assert_function_call()` checks that the function was called with the correct name and arguments.
#     #    - This allows you to assert that the agent's logic for generating function calls is working as expected.
#
#     # 3. **Testing Tools and Agents Separately**
#
#     #    - Tools can be tested independently by directly invoking their `run` method with test inputs.
#     #    - Agents can be tested by simulating messages and observing their interactions through the runtime.
#
#     # 4. **Avoiding Real API Calls**
#
#     #    - By using a mock client, you prevent actual API calls to OpenAI during testing.
#     #    - This reduces costs and allows for consistent, repeatable tests.
#
#     # 5. **Extensibility**
#
#     #    - The mock client can be extended to simulate more complex behaviors, such as generating text outputs or handling errors.
#     #    - Additional utility functions can be created for common assertions and test setups.
#
#     # =============================================================================
#     # Example Extension: Testing Text Output
#     # =============================================================================
#
#     # If you want to test text output from the LLM instead of function calls, you can modify the mock client.
#
#     # In `MockChatCompletionClient`, add functionality to return predefined text responses.
#
#     class MockChatCompletionClient(ChatCompletionClient):
#         # ... existing methods ...
#
#         def set_text_response(self, text: str):
#             self.responses.append(text)
#
#         async def create(
#             self,
#             # ... parameters ...
#         ) -> CreateResult:
#             # ... existing code ...
#             if self.responses:
#                 text_response = self.responses.pop(0)
#                 return CreateResult(
#                     finish_reason="stop",
#                     content=text_response,
#                     usage={"prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 0},
#                     cached=False,
#                 )
#             # ... existing code ...
#
#     # Then, in your test, you can set the expected text response and assert it.
#
#     async def test_agent_text_response():
#         # ... setup code ...
#
#         chat_client.set_text_response("The result is 7.")
#
#         # Run the agent interaction
#
#         # ... code to invoke the agent ...
#
#         # Assert the response
#         assistant_message = generated_messages[-1]
#         assert assistant_message.content == "The result is 7.", "Unexpected assistant response."
#

# # =============================================================================
# # Conclusion
# # =============================================================================
#
# # By creating a mock implementation of `ChatCompletionClient`, you can simulate the LLM's behavior and intercept
# # function calls and text outputs for testing purposes. This approach allows you to validate that your agents and tools
# # are interacting correctly, ensuring stability and correctness in a production environment.
#
# # Key benefits include:
# # - Testing without incurring API costs.
# # - Control over the responses and behaviors of the LLM.
# # - Ability to verify function names, parameters, and outputs.
# # - Improved confidence in the system's reliability before deployment.
#
# # Remember to integrate your tests into your CI/CD pipeline to catch issues early and maintain high code quality.
#
# # **Explanation and Recommendations:**
# #
# # - **MockChatCompletionClient**: This custom client subclasses `ChatCompletionClient` and provides methods to intercept and verify function calls. It simulates the LLM's responses, either returning predefined function calls or text outputs.
# #
# # - **Interception and Verification**: By recording function calls and allowing you to set expected calls and responses, you can assert that the agent generates the correct function calls with the expected parameters.
# #
# # - **Testing Tools and Agents**: The test case demonstrates how to test an agent and its interaction with tools. This ensures that agents correctly interpret user messages, invoke tools as expected, and handle responses.
# #
# # - **Extensibility**: The testing framework can be extended to handle more complex scenarios, including error handling, multiple function calls, and varying responses.
# #
# # - **Avoiding Real API Calls**: Using a mock client prevents unnecessary API calls during testing, saving costs and allowing for consistent, controlled testing environments.
# #
# # - **Example Extension**: The testing framework can be adapted to verify text outputs from the LLM by adding methods to `MockChatCompletionClient`.
# #
# # **Best Practices:**
# #
# # - **Isolate Components**: Test agents, tools, and the runtime separately to pinpoint issues.
# #
# # - **Use Mocks and Stubs**: Replace external dependencies with mocks to create predictable and repeatable tests.
# #
# # - **Assert Expected Behaviors**: Use assertions to verify that the system behaves as intended in various scenarios.
# #
# # - **Automate Testing**: Integrate your tests into an automated testing framework, such as `pytest`, and include them in your CI/CD pipeline.
# #
# # - **Document Test Cases**: Provide clear documentation for each test case, explaining its purpose and expected outcomes.
# #
# # **Next Steps:**
# #
# # - **Expand Tests**: Create additional test cases covering edge cases, error conditions, and complex interactions.
# #
# # - **Parameterize Tests**: Use test parameterization to run the same test logic with different inputs and expected outputs.
# #
# # - **Logging and Diagnostics**: Incorporate logging within your tests to aid in debugging and traceability.
# #
# # - **Continuous Integration**: Configure your CI/CD pipeline to run the tests on each commit, ensuring code changes do not introduce regressions.
